If you need help with your DynamoDB design, modeling or implementation, SenseDeep can help.

As the authors of OneTable, we have deep experience in every aspect of Amazon DynamoDB for projects large and small.

## Design Review

Whether you have a new DynamoDB project or an existing production site, a review of your DynamoDB design can spot and fix potential issues. We can review your table structure, indexes, data modeling, key design, data access patterns and operational practices.

## Design Changes and Migrations

DynamoDB table design changes and migrations with down-time or data risk can be difficult. We have extensive experience evolving live production sites to upgrade DynamoDB tables without impacting user access or data.

## Data Modeling and Mapping

If you are starting out and need guidance with your single-table data model, we can help using proven single-table design patterns and techniques.

## Performance and Cost Optimization and Tuning

We created the OneTable metrics and DynamoDB Metrics libraries to address the serious lack of good DynamoDB performance monitoring tools. We can help tune your DynamoDB service to lower cost and improve performance and scale.
